# Decentralized-College-Tracker

Problem Statement:

In many parts of country, illegal colleges are run, which are not affiliated to any university. Many students enroll in these colleges without knowing that and in turn they end up having no jobs or colleges get shut down after some time, which ruins their career.

Solution:

An immutable solution like Blockchain is needed where all the colleges under a university are tracked as blockchain to ensure that no one can modify any old record. That same solution should also allow banning any college to enroll any new student in case there are any complaints against that college. Later remove the ban once the college addresses all the complaints.
